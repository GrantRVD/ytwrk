# WIP: yt-mango ðŸ’¾

> YT metadata extractor inspired by [`youtube-ma` by _CorentinB_][youtube-ma]

##### Build

Install and compile the Go project with `go get github.com/terorie/yt-mango`!

If you don't have a Go toolchain, grab an executable from the Releases tab

##### Worker mode

A special worker mode uses a [Redis](https://redis.io/)
job queue to manage tasks (uncrawled YouTube videos).
The metadata of each video will be uploaded to a central
[Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) database afterwards.

The process basically consists of three steps and gets repeated possibly forever:
 1. Get a random video page from the job queue.
 2. Visit the video page, and extract info (title, description, etc.)
 3. Get the recommended videos on the page and place new ones into the job queue.

This is essentially a distributed
[Breadth-First-Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
on the entire YouTube page!

Currently, _YT-Mango_ does not know how to find the first video
and will just wait forever if the queue is empty. So you have to enter
the first video ID into the Redis queue by hand for now. You can see
this as a ceremony with ID "5Erj9y4D3iY" as an example:

```
$ redis-cli
localhost:6379> LPUSH VIDEO_WAIT "5Erj9y4D3iY"
```

Then, start yt-mango: 
```
$ yt-mango worker -a json config.yml
2018/08/05 16:20:00 Visited 8ipj7FLS7FQ.
```

By default, yt-mango tries to connect to Redis and Mongo on localhost.
This can be changed using a config file (example in `/example.yml`)
